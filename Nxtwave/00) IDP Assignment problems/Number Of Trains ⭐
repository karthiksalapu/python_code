#Question

#Number Of Trains

# Explanation:

# There's a 2D map representing the railway routes in the form of a M x N matrix.

# In this matrix, each cell is either 1 or 0. A cell 1 represents a part of a train and a cell O represents empty track.

# All trains are placed only horizontally or vertically. The width of each train is exactly one cell.


# In the above image, there are four trains. The cells in brown color represent the train placed vertically, and the cells in pink color represent the train placed horizontally.

# Any two trains are separated by at least one horizontal cell O or vertical cell 0.

# Your task is to find the total number of trains in the matrix.

# Write a program that reads two numbers M, N and a M x N matrix representing the 2D map, and prints a number representing the total number of trains in the matrix.


# Input

# The first line of input contains two space-separated integers representing M and N respectively. The next M lines contains N space-separated integers.

# Output

# The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the total number of trains in the matrix.

# Detailed Explanation: 

# For example, if M=4, N= 4, and the next M lines are,

# 1 0 0 1
# 0 0 0 1
# 1 1 0 1
# 0 0 1 0

# • The first train occupied only one cell, matrix[0][0]

# • The second train occupied two cells, matrix [2][0] to matrix[2][1]

# • The third train occupied only one cell, matrix[3][2]

# • The fourth train occupied three cells, matrix [0] [3] to matrix[2][3]

# The output should be 4.
